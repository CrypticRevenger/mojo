# Welcome to Mojo ðŸ”¥

- Mojo: Ignite Your Coding Passion!
  - Mojo is a new programming language that bridges the gap between research and production by combining Python syntax and ecosystem with systems programming and metaprogramming features. Mojo is still young, but it is designed to become a superset of Python over time.
  
  - Discover the Future of Programming with Mojo, a groundbreaking language that marries the best of Python's simplicity and ecosystem with the power of systems programming and metaprogramming features. While Mojo is still in its infancy, it's on a mission to evolve into the ultimate Python superset.

  - We plan to open-source Mojo progressively over time, but it's changing very quickly now. We believe that a small, tight-knit group of engineers with a shared vision can move faster than a community effort, so we will continue to incubate it within Modular until it's more complete. Please see the [Mojo FAQ](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/faq.html) for more information about this and other common questions.

# ðŸš€ Why Mojo?

- We've opened this repo now because we want to gather issues and engage in feedback from users who have access to the Mojo Playground (our hosted JupyterHub where you can try coding with an early version of Mojo).

- Mojo is more than just another language - it's a revolution! Here's why you should be excited:

  - Fusion of the Familiar and the Future: Mojo brings Python's beloved syntax and rich ecosystem together with innovative systems programming and metaprogramming capabilities. It's the best of both worlds.

  - Incubated Excellence: We're not just open-sourcing Mojo; we're nurturing it with care. Our tight-knit group of visionary engineers is leading the charge. We believe in moving fast and with purpose.
